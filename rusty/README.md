# Split Cycle in Rust

The following directory contains the source for an RIIR ("Rewrite It In Rust") operation on the Split Cycle algorithm. The result is an experimental implementation of Split Cycle that aims to be faster than the existing [Python implementation in this repository](../splitcycle/) and faster than the [Split Cycle implementation in the industry-standard, Numba-accelerated `pref_voting` package](https://pref-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/margin_based_methods.html#split-cycle).
